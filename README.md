# detDyn
Package for doing standard deterministic dynamical system's analysis in python. Inpsired by [DynamicalSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl)

Inspired in part by https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl.

## Roadmap

1. [ ] **Goal 0**: Have basic integrator/observer system setup.
    1. [ ] Create example notebooks for common workflows, including integration, observation and m-state computation.
    2. [ ] Documentation and unit tests.
2. [ ] **Goal 1**: Add lyapunov computation functionality
    1. [ ] Lyapunov spectrum & CLVs when tlm provided.
    2. [ ] Jax for auto-generation of tlm.
3. [ ] **Phase 2**: Add discrete dynamics
